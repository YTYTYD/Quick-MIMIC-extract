                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: History of multple myeloma and pulmonary embolus in [**2107-12-9**].
 Severe bronchospasm and subtherapeutic INR.  Evaluate for recurrent pulmonary
 embolus.

 COMPARISON: Single view chest [**2108-4-10**].

 TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images through the chest were obtained following the
 administration of 100 cc of Optiray due to CT angiogram technique. Multiplanar
 reformatted images were obtained.

 CT ANGIOGRAM CHEST: The bolus timing is suboptimal, but there are no large
 filling defects within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolus.
 There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Emphysematous
 changes are noted bilaterally. There are no pleural effusions.

 Small, punched-out lytic lesions are noted scattered throughout the spine,
 consistent with known multiple myeloma.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. No evidence of acute or chronic pulmonary embolus.
 2. Emphysematous changes bilaterally.
 3. Small lytic bony lesions throughout the spine consistent with multiple
 myeloma.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary - Dyspnea secondary to chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease/emphysema under this hospital course.
Briefly, the patient received BIPAP, ....................,
intravenous Solu-Medrol, nebulizer treatment and inhaler
treatment while in the Intensive Care Unit.  She was able to
be weaned off of the oxygen back to room air, sating to about
93 or 94 percent.

Though her chest x-rays show hyperinflation and no signs of
infection, she was given five days worth of Zithromax.  An
echocardiogram was to rule out any cardiac wheezes which then
showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, mild right
ventricular dilation and mild pulmonary arterial pressure.
Pulmonary function tests were performed showing obstructive
pattern with FEC of 2.56 which is 93% of the predicted and
FEV1 of 0.9 which is 43% of the predicted in FEV1 to FEC
ratio of 46%.

When the patient was transferred to the Medical Floor, a CT
was performed showed no evidence of a pulmonary embolism but
did show signs of emphysema.  Sputum cultures were sent and
showed no growth of any organism.  Alpha antitrypsin was sent
out but is still pending.

2.  Pulmonary Embolism - The patient was continued on
Coumadin for an INR between 2 and 3.  Since she was
subtherapeutic, she was started on Lovenox until she became
therapeutic on the Coumadin.

3.  Psychiatry - Anxiety.  The patient was quite anxious
during the hospital course.  Psychiatry was called to consult
and recommended that she be on Risperidone at 0.25 mg q hs.
The patient did well on this medication.

4.  Oncology - Multiple myeloma.  A protein electrophoresis
was done showing a monoclonal IGG capa gammaglobulinopathy
(60% of the total protein in [**2108-1-8**], but now is 66%
of total protein on [**2108-4-9**], despite q weekly
Dexamethasone treatment.  Bone marrow biopsy was done
revealing 70 to 80 percent plasma cells.  Given these
findings, the patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**]
for start of chemotherapy with Vincristine,
................... and Decadron in preparation for bone
marrow transplant to be done.

finally reached 2.3 on day of discharge, so her Lovenox was
discontinued.  The patient is to continue taking 4 mg of
Coumadin at bedtime, and to have her INR checked in the next
week with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2819**].
