# How to Run

This plan consists of two parts. One part is a database query program written in SQL for extracting data; the other part is an extraction script written by the user in Python for integrating the extracted data.

## Compiling the Extraction Program:
### Environment Setup
1. Ensure MS SQL Server is installed on your device. We use MS SQL Server 2019 and import MIMIC data into the database.
2. Ensure pymssql is installed on your device to connect to MS SQL Server, you can use pip install pymssql.
3. If parallel processing is needed, install multiprocessing with pip install multiprocessing.

### Program Import
4. Run .sql files in MS SQL Server, including check_subject.sql, drug_diff.sql, text.sql, timeframe+static+timeseries.sql.
5. Configure the database connection in Python and run the .py file MIMIC-III_multi_extrat.py:

"""Configuration"""
server='127.0.0.1'  # Server IP address
user ='sa'  # Username
password='123456'  # Password
database='mimic4'  # Database name
# port='1433'
"""Connect to the database"""
conn = pymssql.connect(server, user, password, database)
cursor = conn.cursor()

4. Modify the output address at line 156 in MIMIC-III_multi_extrat.py:   
with open(r'C://Users//pdl//Desktop//csv//'+str(HADM_ID)+".csv", "w", newline='') as f:
